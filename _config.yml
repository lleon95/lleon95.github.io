intro: |
  I am an Electronics Engineer with High-Performance Computing and Hardware Acceleration expertise. I graduated as Electronics Engineer with honours from ITCR and as Master in High-Performance Computing from SISSA/ICTP in Italy. Currently, I am pursuing a second Master's in Electronics Engineering at ITCR, where I am researching about approximate Deep Learning inference acceleration on low-power devices, mainly on FPGAs.<br/><br/>
  I started programming in 2010, where I have been exposed to many fields, from Web, IOT, Electronics, and Linux. I have three years of experience in Industry, working for RidgeRun LLC and eXact Lab. I am also a free researcher at ITCR, where I collaborate with Approximate Computing topics.<br/><br/>

   <strong>High-Performance Computing</strong>: In the last 2 years, I have been working in algorithm optimisation for soft/firm real-time applications in multimedia streaming and industrial applications. I am currently specialist in intrinsics (AVX2/AVX512/NEON), multi-threading (OpenMP), distributed computing (OpenMPI/IntelMPI), and general-purpose graphics acceleration (CUDA). Additionally, it has involved deep knowledge about system's architecture and FORTRAN/C/C++ languages at compiler level to unlock the potential of software implementations. I have written the following <a href="https://www.ridgerun.com/post/why-can-t-we-get-100-of-the-cpu-peak-performance">article</a> for RidgeRun's blog<br/><br/>
   <strong>Hardware Acceleration</strong>: My research field of interest is hardware acceleration on low-power devices like FPGAs. I am currently specialised in High-Level Synthesis on Xilinx platforms. I am currently working on the deep learning inference acceleration at the Edge, where I am supervising a couple of bachelor's theses related to IP Core generation for fast Matrix-Matrix multiplication and Winograd/FFT Convolution. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Linux</strong>: As part of my duties, I am familiarised with the Linux kernel and its internal structures, specially, for creating device drivers for camera sensors, and I2C devices. Most software I work on run on Linux.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Internet of Things</strong>: I am currently working on a software backbone for supporting serverless IoT applications based on function lambdas (similar to AWS) with MQTT and multi-database support. The idea is to offer an open source solution for baremetal deployments<br/><br/>
